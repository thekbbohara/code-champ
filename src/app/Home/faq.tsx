      question: "How does anti-cheating system work?",
      answer: "We prevent users from copying and pasting solutions by disabling these actions in the input fields. Additionally, we track user activity within the pageâ€”if the user switches to another tab, leaves the page, or tries to open a new tab during the match, the system will automatically end the session, and the user will lose the match. This approach helps maintain a fair and focused environment for all participants."
